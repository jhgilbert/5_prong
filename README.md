The goal is simple: measure how much of my time is spent in one or more basic zones of fulfillment. 
For a calmer experience that doesn't feel quite so technical or stressful, the simple UI deliberately avoids offering much feedback beyond OFF and ON.

The data structure is made up of intervals with a start/stop timestamp, category, and so on. I'd like to take that data and process/visualize it in a variety of ways. I'd also like to connect mobile and Pebble versions, so that intervals can be started/stopped from anywhere.
